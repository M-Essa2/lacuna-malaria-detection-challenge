🦟 Lacuna Malaria Detection Challenge

Leveraging AI and global collaboration to improve malaria detection through data-driven innovation.

📌 Overview

This repository contains our submission for the Lacuna Malaria Detection Challenge
 — a global competition aimed at improving malaria detection through open data, collaboration, and advanced machine learning.

Hosted on Zindi Africa, the challenge brings together researchers, data scientists, and developers to create high-performance models that can assist in rapid, accurate malaria diagnosis using microscopy images.

Supported by major partners, including the Lacuna Fund, Google.org, The Rockefeller Foundation, and Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC), the initiative has provided over $8 million in grants to support 58 datasets from around the world.

🎯 Objectives

Improve malaria detection accuracy using deep learning

Support generalization across diverse microscopy images

Advocate for open data sharing and reusable documentation

Drive innovation in diagnostic AI for low-resource settings

🧠 Methodology
1️⃣ Dataset

Our workflow uses microscopy images of blood smears labeled for malaria infection status. We emphasize:

High-quality preprocessing

Balanced class representation

Well-documented metadata

2️⃣ Data Augmentation

To enhance model learning:

ImageDataGenerator(
    rotation_range=20,
    zoom_range=0.2,
    width_shift_range=0.1,
    height_shift_range=0.1,
    brightness_range=[0.8,1.2],
    horizontal_flip=True
)

3️⃣ Model Architectures

We explored:

Custom CNNs

Transfer Learning (e.g., EfficientNet, ResNet variants)

Ensemble methods

Hyperparameter optimization

4️⃣ Synthetic Data Generation

Using generative models (GANs/VAEs) to expand underrepresented classes:
